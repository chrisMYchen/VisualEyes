Fitness tracker that aims to help visualize how much progress and work you have made towards your fitness goals.
VisualSize allows the user to see their progress in tangible terms- you've run 10 times the height of the empire state building, 
or lifted the equivalent of 20 elephants. These kinds of images give users a better feel for the work they've done to motivate
them to keep going.
